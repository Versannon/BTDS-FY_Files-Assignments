AIM: To generate the Fibonacci series up to a given number of terms.
Objective: To understand the concept of iterative loops and sequence generation in Python.
Theory: The Fibonacci series is a sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.
Program: (no need to print the code here.)
Output: (no need to give output here.)
Explanation: The program uses a loop to calculate and print the Fibonacci series up to the number of terms specified by the user.
