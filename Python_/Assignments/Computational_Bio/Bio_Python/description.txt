Q_1. The plotly package is a powerful, open-source graphing library that allows you to create interactive, publication-quality visualizations in Python, R, Julia, and JavaScript. It's especially popular for its rich interactivity and integration with Jupyter Notebooks and web apps.
It provides functionality for:
->Creating interactive plots:
    -Hover info
    -Zoom
    -Pan
    -Select data points
->Supporting a wide variety of chart types:
    -Line, Bar, Pie, Scatter, Area
    -Box, Violin, Histogram, Heatmaps
    -3D plots, Geo plots, Choropleths
    -Ternary, Polar, Bubble charts, and more
->Customization:
    -Themes
    -Colors
    -Annotations
    -Subplots
->Integration with Dash:
    -Create full web apps using Plotly figures
->Export options:
    -Static images (via Kaleido/Orca)
    -HTML
    -JSON

Popular Plotly Libraries:

    -> plotly.py – for Python
    -> plotly.R – for R
    -> dash – for building interactive dashboards and web apps in Python using Plotly

Q_2. What is Bio python?

Bio python is an open-source collection of python tools used for computational biology and bioinformatics.
It provides functionality for:
->Reading and writing bioinformatics file formats;
    -FASTA
    -GENBANK,etc
->performing sequence analysis
->accessing online biological databases (e.g., NCBI)
->Working with biological structures and alignments

Key Features of Bio-python:

    -> Feature description.
    -> Sequence handling:
        -Represent and manipulate DNA, RNA or protein sequences.
    -> File parsing:
        -supports a wide range of formats, such as;
        ->FASTA, GENBANK,etc.
    -> NCBI access.
        -Fetch sequences and run BLAST searches.
    -> Structural Biology:
        -Parse and analyze protein structures using PDB.
    -> Alignments:
        -Read, Write and manipulate sequence alignments.
    -> Graphics:
        -Plot Graphical content, codon uses and visualize genomic features.

Modules used in Biopython:

    -> Bio.Seq: for sequence manipulation and analysis.
    -> Bio.SeqIO: for reading and writing sequence files in various formats.
    -> Bio.Align: for working with sequence alignments.
    -> Bio.PDB: for parsing and analyzing protein structures.
    -> Bio.Entrez: for accessing NCBI databases and retrieving sequences.
    -> Bio.Blast: for performing BLAST searches.
    -> Bio.Graphics: for creating graphical representations of biological data.
    -> Bio.Cluster: for clustering biological data.
