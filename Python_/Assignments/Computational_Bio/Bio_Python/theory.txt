Questions:

Q.1: Why do we need statistical function in python?
-> Understanding Data:
    a) Raw data is useless without summarizing.
    b) Statistical functions like mean, median, sd, etc. help us to summarize, understand and interpret large datasets.
    c) e.g., Instead of looking 10000 salary entries, you can just look at mean salary range and sd to understand the spread.

-> Making informed decisions:
    a) In fields like healthcare, finance, etc., statistical analysis helps in risk assessment.
    b) Data-driven decisions lead to better outcomes.
    c) Libraries like numpy, pandas, and scipy are optimized for speed & accuracy.

-> Handling big datasets quickly:
    a) Python can work with large amounts of data.
    b) Statistical functions allow you to compute results in seconds (instead of manual calculations, which would take days).
    c) e.g., Numpy and pandas are optimized for performance and can handle large datasets efficiently.
    d) Libraries like Dask can also be used for parallel computing on large datasets.

-> Data cleaning and pre-processing:
    a) Before building any machine learning model or visualization, we must check for missing values, outliers, skewness, etc.
    b) Statistical measures detect problems in data.
    c) e.g., A very high standard deviation might signal outliers that you should remove.

-> Comparing datasets:
    a) Suppose you have scores from two different exams, you can use mean, variance & skewness to compare them fairly.

-> Supporting machine learning models:
    a) Machine learning models assume that data has certain statistical properties (like normal distribution.)
    b) Feature engineering often uses statistics:
        1: Mean normalization.
        2: Standardization (Z-score, etc).
    c) Logistic regression assumes that input features are scaled, achieved by 'SD'.

-> Visualization and reporting:
    a) Statistical summaries help us to create beautiful visualizations like :
        1: Histogram (Show distribution).
        2: Boxplot (Shows spread and outliers).
        3: Bell Curves (Normal distribution).
    b) You can't visualize smartly without understanding the underlying statistics.


Q.2: Summary of statistical functions in python.

-> Summarize data - Mean, median, mode.
-> Understand spread - Variance, Range, Standard Deviation.
-> Detect patterns & anomalies of data - Skewness & kurtosis.
-> Make decisions - Comparing means and Variances.
-> Prepare data for models - Normalization and scaling.
-> Communicate findings - Summary reports and graphs.
-> Libraries - Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
